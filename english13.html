Critical thinking<br><br>

a. Pun says, “We do not have culture of innovation that encourages young people to be innovative and creative”. Do you agree with him? Explain.<br>
An innovation culture is part of the corporate culture and determines how much innovation is supported and promoted by management and employees. The culture of innovation is therefore the framework for every innovation activity. If the culture is not positive, it can hinder innovation, even if the idea and the innovation team are still perfect. It is thus a decisive factor in the success of innovation.
<br><br>
Our country Nepal is said to be a developing country but development process is very slow here. Our education system is still based on paper and classrooms, and it hasn’t changed much over the years. There is no opportunities for young people who are likely to do something new since we do not have culture of encouraging them. Innovative and creative thinking are not encouraged in our educational system. Every year, thousands of students leave the country in pursuit of a higher education because of this. A research-based education is usually given the highest emphasis in industrialised nations. To do this, they invest a great deal of money and effort. Our culture discourages young people from taking risks, therefore there are no possibilities for them in Nepal.
<br><br><br>
b. What qualities does an individual need to become an entrepreneur?<br>
Entrepreneurs are innovative pioneers who venture opportunities and create new market at home and aboard. Becoming an entrepreneur requires more than just a creative idea. All entrepreneurs share commonalities in their attributes, abilities and qualities that empower them to beat the chances and pursue their objectives.
<br><br>
Successful entrepreneurs need to see success. Many of the top businessmen around have seen a product and the associated success that could possibly come with it. If he/she don’t plan extensively about their new idea or concept, without thinking ahead, they might encounter unforeseen difficulties with management or cashflow. Perseverance is a key in becoming a full-time entrepreneur. A true entrepreneur will be able to prevent the feeling of being burnt out, if they know what their goals are, and if they love the task of always having to meet deadlines. Discipline is also the key in this field, as an entrepreneur must work hard in order to achieve.
<br><br>
Entrepreneurs also need to manage their time properly. There’s no point in spending a whole day over a task, when in reality it will be cheaper and more effective to hire someone to help you with a certain task, thus enabling you to produce more profit. A successful entrepreneur must have an air or a grace about him that will demand respect from other individuals.
<br><br>
Successful entrepreneurs are never secure in their field, although this may be the same with other bog-standard jobs, however the rewards that can be obtained from having the mentioned attributes can be really substantial. By working hard and never giving up, an individual is bound to become a successful entrepreneur.
