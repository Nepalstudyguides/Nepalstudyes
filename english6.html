Critical thinking<br>
<br>
a. What do you do you to keep yourself fit? What food do you avoid and why?<br>
Staying fit is a great way to improve our mood and overall health. Many people struggle with staying fit over time, but the benefits of fitness definitely outweigh the costs. With some commitment and motivation, we can maintain our physical fitness for years to come! I do regular exercising and take balanced diet to keep myself fit.
<br><br>
I avoid any junk food, foods which are high in sugar like donuts, cakes, cookies and the foods which are high in fat like processed meats, hydrogenated oil and shortening. I do so because it is one of the most important components of a fit lifestyle. Many people ignore it, but if we exercise and eat a lot of unhealthy foods like junk foods we will not get any fitter. This is because the junk food turns to fat almost immediately. Junk foods contain poor nutrition and are high in sodium and sugar. Because of this, our body sugar levels drop after consumption and we end up feeling fatigued with a major lack of energy.

<br><br>
3. People must be made awared of the communicable diseases through advertisements and mass media.
