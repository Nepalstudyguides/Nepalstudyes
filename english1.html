Critical thinking<br><br>

a. ‘All children have the right to quality education. How can we ensure this right to every child? Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend school.’<br>
Quality education is the demand of 21st century. There is different aspects related to get the quality education. The role of parents, government and schools are the main stakeholders related to a student’s quality education.<br><br>

Role of Government<br>
– The government can subsidize education in several forms including school fees for low-income parents.<br>
– Providing equality in education whereby the government ensures that the public schools offer a high quality of knowledge to the learners.<br>
– A government should ensure that teachers are well paid so that they are motivated in the provision of their services.<br>
– A government should put in place rules that could check to eliminate outdated syllabus since it misdirects many teachers and learners in schools.<br><br><br>

Roles of Parents<br>
– Kids would be easily inspired by what their parents do. So it would be good to be a role model in their learning phase.<br>
– Parents should talk to their kid about how their school life and different memories associated with it.<br>
– Parents should help them to be more organized with their daily routine and find enough time for the lessons.<br>
– Parents should make sure that the kids are provided with a peaceful and pleasant atmosphere at home.<br><br><br>

b.’Do you think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of providing education in our country? What strategies do you suggest to overcome such discrimination against girls?’<br>
Education in Nepal is still in its background phase. While advancements have been made to provide free education through government schools, this education is widely considered to be insufficient in comparison to the education provided by private schools. In comparison to private schools, government schools are less funded and provide a poorer quality of education. Despite this, a large number of girls are enrolled in government schools, while their brothers receive the opportunity for quality, or at least better, education in private schools. This disparity can be traced back to a history of gender based marginalization in the Nepalese society. More significantly, girls are discriminated in terms of education because their parents think that they go to their new homes after their marriage and cannot care their parents when they get older. Finally people still believe that males are physically, mentally and politically strong so that parents send their sons to high quality schools and girls to lower one.<br><br>

A number of strategies should be applied by all to afford education to the girls to bring about the prosperity of the nation. Some of them are listed below:<br><br>

1. Gender biases should be ended.<br>
2. Women should be given platforms to be in power and achieve economic success.<br>
3. Violence and sexual assault against women should be ended.<br>
4. The preference for the son should be removed from the people’s psychology.<br>
5. Money given in the name of dowry should be invested in the girl’s education.<br><br><br>

c. ‘A Chinese philosopher Confucius said, “If your plan is for one year, plant rice; if your plan is for ten years, plant trees; if your plan is for one hundred years, educate children.” What is the meaning of this saying? Elaborate this with examples.’<br>
The sole meaning of above statement is that our destination decide what type of efforts should be applied. If our set our goals and destination big then surely it will take a long time to achieve it. One of the philosophical doctrines presented by the Chinese philosopher before Christ, confusion is the key factor for bringing prolonged dimensional change in the life of people. It is not like planting rice and planting trees whose output appears within a year or within a decade. We have to wait for almost a century to get better result.<br><br>

Actually the above statement is explaining about the importance of education. At present time people without education is just like a pen without ink. Education shapes our future. It makes us well reputed in the society. Furthermore, without education thinking of a developed country is just like building castle in air. If today’s children are provided a quality education then they will play a crucial role in the development of the nation and create civilized society in future. Therefore, children should be provided with the best possible education as an investment so that it will benefit the whole country in the future.<br><br><br>
