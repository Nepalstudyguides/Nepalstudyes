<br><br><br>


Reference to the context<br><br>

<br><br>
b. Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow.<br>
“…the black parts are snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks around the middle, and if I touch one of them, I’ll be bitten and I’ll die before tea time.

<br>
c. Which images and metaphors are used in the story?<br><br>
The main metaphor in the story “The Wish” by Roald Dahl is the child’s journey along the carpet as a representation of the obstacles and challenges he faces as he matures. Vivid images that Dahl uses to reinforce the metaphor include the scab as the boy’s primary challenge, the red spots on the carpet as hot lumps of coal, and the black sections as evil poisonous snakes.
<br><br>
d. Summarize the short story “The Wish” in about 200 words.<br>
(Look at top of the page)<br><br><br>

e. The story shows the events through the eyes of the narrator and the child. Comparing the two styles, who presents a more interesting or effective view for the readers? Why?<br>
In “The Wish,” a boy uses his imagination to travel across a red, black, and yellow carpet. The child’s represents the story in more interesting and effective than the narrator’s, because it is vivid and suspenseful. The child was a in a hardship situation and he faces hardships and won all the challenges as motivated by a Birthday gift as a puppy by completing his journey at the end.
<br><br>
f. Is “The Wish” a story about self-confidence overcoming fear or about greed? Give your arguments.<br>
Roald Dahl’s “The Wish” is about self-confidence overcoming fear rather than about greed aa it is all about self-confidence and overcoming fear. Admittedly, “greed,” the desire for a puppy, is a motivating factor. However, the puppy motivator is a fantasy that boy has made up to help him overcome his fear of crossing the treacherous carpet. He says to himself, ‘if I get across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow.
<br><br>
The child seems fearful while watching his scab. He thinks much about picking it. He raises many questions with himself. He picks out his scab being panic. But when he sees the carpet his fear increases high. He gathers his confidence to cross the carpet. He creates his obstacles supposing the colours as coals and snakes. He even puts his goal across the carpet. He moves on bravely on the carpet wishing for a puppy on his birthday as a birthday gift. He tries his best to overcome his fear. His self-confidence and his wish end as he falls down in black colours.
<br><br>
Even the puppy becomes part of his project of overcoming fears to achieve a goal: But the fear of not getting the puppy compelled him to go on. This tale enters into the mind of an imaginative child and reflects the child’s ability to turn something as common place as a patterned carpet into a scene of adventure and challenge in which he can act out his fears in a safe environment.

Reference beyond the text<br><br>

a. Do you think our wish can be fulfilled? Why or why not?<br>
Having wishes is significant in itself. But not all the wants, desire and wishes are fulfilled. We need hard and complicated practice to fulfil our wish, want, desire, and interest. If a wish comes true, it is one of the most beautiful things on earth. It is, therefore, essential to deal constructively with the obstacles on the way to your wish. Some of the common hurdles that stops us from fulfilling our wishes are:
<br><br>
– I have no money for it / I don’t want to spend my money on it<br>
– I want to, but I don’t have time for it /I’m too caught up in my everyday life<br>
– I’m scared. Fear of failure. Afraid of making the wrong decision. Afraid to disappoint other people<br>
– I have doubts whether it is right for me<br><br>

So to fulfill our wishes we should deal with above mentioned problems. For this we can do the following things:<br>
<br>
– Try to realize the wish in the small version. Try to satisfy the need behind the wish.<br>
– Trick everyday life and proceed in small steps.<br>
– Address fears and debunk them as much as possible.<br>
– Create clarity. Get a clear picture of where we want to go.<br>
– Strengthen self-image so that our wishes becomes possible.<br>
<br>
b. Why do you think some people might have a frightening nature? What would you suggest to them to overcome it?<br>
Some people might have a frightening nature due to the lack of self-confidence and being less sociable. Some people, especially innocent ones easily lose their confidence as they face obstacles in their paths of life.
<br><br>
I would suggest the following points to overcome it:<br>
– Learn more about your fear, this first step can be the hardest one but it’s also absolutely necessary.<br>
– Use your imagination in positive ways.<br>
– Use your brain in a different way than usual.<br>
– Focus on your breathing.<br>
– Practice mindfulness.<br>
– Use nature as your therapist.<br>
