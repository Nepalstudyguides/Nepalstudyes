<br>
Critical thinking<br>
<br>
a. The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of the autocratic rulers. Present your view for or against this statement.<br>
Yes, I believe that the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal were created by autocratic rulers. The Great Wall of China was built to protect the northern empire of China from enemy attacks. There are nineteen walls. The first wall was built in the 7th century BC.
<br><br>
The Great Wall of China cannot be built by individual effort. As punishment, people were forced to undertake such projects by autocratic rulers. The text mentions that people throughout the empire must share responsibility with each other. If a person did not behave according to the rules, others had to contact them. If they did not, they were dismembered or beheaded. Those who made the greatest contribution to the state were highly rewarded, while those whose lives were deemed inconsequential were used as slaves in Shi Huangdi’s construction projects such as the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal, and the streets that grew up in the simple trade and travel.
<br><br>
Likewise, Taj Mahal is the result of the autocratic ruler of the Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. It is believed that he built it to immortalize his wife Mumtaz. Shah Jahan is said to have cut off the artists’ hands to prevent them from recreating the same type of structure. Historical facts show that the king was more inconsiderate than romantic. It took 20,000 workers to build the Taj Mahal over 20 years.
<br><br>
Everyone remembers the names of the emperors who built the structures, but no one is eager to explore the reality behind the structures. Therefore, The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal can be considered as the creation of the autocratic rulers.
<br><br>
b. How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism?<br>
Feudalism is defined as a dominant social system that existed in Europe during the Middle Ages in which people worked and fought for nobles who gave them protection and the use of land in return.
<br><br>
Pros of feudalism<br>
Feudalism helped protect communities from the violence and warfare that broke out after the fall of Rome and the collapse of strong central government in Western Europe. Feudalism secured Western Europe’s society and kept out powerful invaders. The Lords were the major persons who keep away people’s worries. Feudalism helped people to develop the qualities like loyalty, bravery, generosity, and humility.
<br><br>
Cons of feudalism<br>
The concept of feudalism used to divide poor and rich people into two classes. It created class divisions among people. Common and weak people had to be dependent upon the Lords. Easy environment for powerful people to impose their power over others. Lords could easily do whatever they wanted. Peasants had to survive under the lords and they were not allowed to leave their lords’ land. They were restricted in movement and even daily activities without their lords’ permission.

Writing<br>
<br>
a. Write an email to your friend living abroad stating the contributions of Prithvi Narayan Shah in the unification of Nepal.
<br><br>
To: ariana23@gmail.com<br>
<br>
From: austinadam56@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Subject: Contributions of Prithivi Narayan Shah in the Unification of Nepal<br>
<br>
Following the recent discussions on the above subject, here are more clarifications on the immeasurable contributions that Prithivi Narayan Shah brought to ensure that Nepal is what it is today.
<br><br>
Shah ended the divisions and infighting that existed between the four major Nepalese principalities of Gorkha, Malla, Patan, and Bhadgaon. Though the prince was a very ambitious member of the Shah ruling family of Gorkha, his personal involvement brought the wars among Malla, Patan, and Bhadgaon to an end.
<br><br>
He did not stop there. He resolved their long-term differences and consolidated them to become modern-day Nepal. Shah also worked hard to strengthen the unity of Nepal. This unity ended the many years when foreigners could easily invade any of the small states to conquer them.
<br><br>
No doubt, you will appreciate that this was not a mere achievement. While others were dividing nations, he united. While others conquered nations for their selfish interests, he strengthened Nepal for national unity.
<br><br>
From this brief email, you will appreciate that Shah made lasting contributions to the Nepal we can call home today.
<br><br>
