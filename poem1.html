You’ll be back to your cave time<br>
That you endured<br>
Long, long, long ago …<br>

The earth is not your property alone –<br>
It’s as much ours as yours.<br>
<br>
In the given lines, the speaker denotes that the earth is the common habitat of all the living creatures. All of them have an equal right to use the resources available on earth, to sustain their lives. But we human beings are ruling over others thinking ourselves as superior and depriving them of using resources. The speaker is worried about growing human pressure on natural world. They have controlled all the natural resources for their own benefits though the earth is the common home for all the living organisms. In the name of development and progress, humans are destroying the sources of food and habitats of other creatures. In this way, slowly and slowly entire ecosystem is being destroyed.

<br>
a. What human behaviours are responsible for suffering in people’s lives?<br>
The human behaviours are the main cause behind all these sufferings of the people. Due to human egos, their greediness and bad deeds, the present world is facing a lot of crisis. Many people have lost their lives during this critical period. Due to their selfish nature, the earth have faced numerous problems of diseases. Their so-called egos and wars have snatched the lives of many people. Hence, human beings themselves are responsible for suffering in people’s lives.
<br><br>

An epidemic is a widespread disease that affects many people in a population whereas pandemic is a disease that affects a wide geographical area and a large proportion of the population.

Coronavirus is one of the greatest threat of the twenty-first century. This disease has taken away the lives of numerous number of people. People in the world are panic-stricken and living their life in mental fear. Businesses are down and economic crisis is seen all over the world. Many peoples are jobless, homeless and due to the scarcity of food also many peoples are dying. But due to the impact of Corona Virus, environment is clean and pollution free than before. As peoples are caged inside their houses, many of the industries are closed and the numbers of vehicles on the road is also decreased. Due to this the environment is cleaner and fresher than before.
