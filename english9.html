<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
f. What is the main point of Mandela’s speech?<br>
The main point of Mandela’s speech is that people of South Africa should build a society where there will be justice, peace and equality for all peoples.
<br><br><br>


Critical thinking<br>
<br>
a. What does Mandela mean when he says – a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world?<br>
When Mandela says – a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world he means that South Africans should build a society where both black and white will be able to walk, talk with each other without any fear. We know that rainbow is the combination of seven different colors. So by saying a rainbow nation he is trying to convey us a message that whenever all the peoples unite as like the colors in the rainbow then only there will be peace.
<br><br>
In South Africans cultures, the rainbow symbolizes hope and bright future. South Africa is referred to a Rainbow Nation to describe the unity of various cultural, racial or ethnic groups in the country. During the segregation period, peoples were divided on the basis of skin color. Mandela wants them to live and work together in unity like the colors in a rainbow. He wished they could forget the ferocious and brutal past and put their hand in hand with each other and maintain a peaceful nation.
<br><br>
b. Mandela should have avenged those who imprisoned him for such a long period. Instead, he followed the path of reconciliation. Why do you think he did so?
If Mandela has avenged those ho had prisoned him then he won’t be able to reach his destination. Mandela led his country wisely and promoted national reconciliation. He was a man of true words. He fought for his own people for a long period and was also imprisoned when he raised his voice against the authorities. However, after coming out of jail he did not avenge those who had put him in trouble. Because he believed that avenge and enmity cause disorder among people and by doing so he would lose the support of the majority.
<br><br>
c. Why and how have societies struggled with segregation in the world? Do you find any evidence of segregation in your society? Discuss.
Segregation is the separation or isolation of a race, class, or ethnic group by enforced or voluntary residence in a restricted area, by barriers to social intercourse or separate educational facilities or by other discriminatory means. Many people of the world are struggling with social separation problem in the world.Racial segregation is one of many types of segregation, which can range from deliberate and systematic persecution through more subtle types of discrimination to self-imposed separation. Cast segregation is one of the most common forms of segregation in the Hindu culture. Any types of segregation can lead to chaos and voilence.
<br><br>
Yes I have found the evidneces of segregation in my society. Although, the Nepalese Constitution Law doesn’t allow any segregation in terms of religion, caste and ethnicity but still it is prevalent in our society. However, since the unification of Nepal in the 18th century, Nepal’s various non-Hindu ethnic nationalities and tribes, previously called “Matwalis” (alcohol-drinkers) and now termed as “Adivasi/Janajati” (indigenous/nationalities), have been incorporated within the caste hierarchy to varying degrees of success. Despite the forceful integration by the state into the pan-Hindu social structure, the traditionally non-Hindu groups and tribes do not necessarily adhere to the customs and practices of the caste segregation.

Writing<br>
<br>
a. Nepal has topsy-turvy political history. Many changes have been observed in different times. Write a short biography of any Nepali freedom fighter incorporating the changes brought under his/her leadership.
Ganesh Man Singh<br><br>
<br><br>
Ganesh Man Singh was born on November 9, 1915 and was commander of the popular 1990 Janaandolan. Singh was also one of the main leaders of the Nepali Congress movement of 1951, which overthrew the Rana regime. More than anything else, Ganesh Man was a rebel and a freedom fighter. He was a popular hero and his exploits are legendary. He was a man of small proportions but charismatic, fearless, and physically very strong. He was never afraid of taking risks in his political career. He was a straightforward and frank leader in dealing with all.
<br><br>
Ganesh Man was a rare breed amongst Nepali politicians—a man of integrity. He demonstrated his greatness through his leadership, rising above petty personal interests. Recognising his outstanding contribution to the field of democracy and human rights, Ganesh Man was honored by the United Nations with the ‘Human Rights Award’ in 1993. He was the first statesman from South Asia to receive this prestigious award. He also received the ‘United States Peace Run Prize’ in 1990 for his contribution to peace in Nepal and the world. He was also decorated with the ‘U Thant Peace Award’. He has become immortalised as a great leader that the nation and its citizens, without any political barriers, feel proud of. No other national leader has been able to fill the political vacuum after his death.
