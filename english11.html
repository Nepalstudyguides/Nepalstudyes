Critical Thinking<br>
<br>
a. Do you agree with Machiavelli’s view that a good leader can do bad and dishonest things in order to preserve his power and protect his government? Explain.<br>
Yes I agree with Machiavelli’s view that a good leader can do bad and dishonest things in order to preserve his power and protect his government. Machiavelli was a politician and writer. Machiavelli reveals several facts that how a good leader can turn into immoral and evil. He says that in order to maintain power and protect nation or territory, a leader makes a number of mistakes.
<br><br>
It’s the duty of a leader to protect his government. So he can go beyond the rules and perform dishonest things to preserve his power. But the leaders whose goal is the pursuit of power, unlimited wealth, or the fame that accompanies success often appear self-centered. This desire is so strong that the leaders violate the moral standards that once governed their conduct. Many leaders reach the top by imposing their will on others, or even destroying those who stand in their way. When they reach the top, they may suspect that others are trying to knock them off their base and hence perform some out of the rules things to protect their leadership.
<br><br>
b. Do you think that art and literature are important assets of a country? Give reasons.<br>
Art and literature are the foundation of life. It places an emphasis on many topics from human tragedies to tales of the ever-popular search for love. While it is physically written in words, these words come alive in the imagination of the mind, and its ability to comprehend the complexity or simplicity of the text.
<br><br>
Art and literature serves the people, and help them in their struggle for a better life, by arousing the people’s emotions against oppression and injustice and increasing their sensitivity regarding the people’s sufferings. Our country is facing the tremendous challenge of abolishing poverty, unemployment, inflation, ignorance, casteism, communalism, and other social evils, and hence artists and writers must join the ranks of those who are struggling for a better Nepal, they must inspire the people by their writings, and write against oppression and injustice. Thus we can say that art and literature are important assets of a country.
<br><br>

Writing<br>
<br>
a. Write an essay on “Literature is the reflection of society.”<br><br>
Literature is the Reflection of Society<br>
<br>
Since the dawn of man, the art of storytelling was utilized to pass on critically deemed information about society, life, and everything. During the early days, much of our history was transposed orally through song and spoken word. Literature, like many art forms, is expressionism. It’s taking a thought and converting it into a tangible object that can be interpreted by others.
<br><br>
Many authors have been represented social, political, ecological, historical, scientific phenomenon in their works. All our glorious past has secured in the literary pages so that today’s generation gain knowledge about the myth of The Ramayana, The Mahabharata, The Old Testament and The Bible, etc. it is only possible by the literary sources that present generation know who were our forefathers and how human came into existence.
<br><br>
Thus, society creates literature because all traditions, customs, religious stories reflect through the literary works, but the excellence and natural surroundings of the reflection hinge on a writer’s approach of mind, whether he is enlightened in his outlook or conservative. That’s why literature is the mirror of society because it stuffed with all human emotions and activities including good and bad and social and political happenings.
<br>
b. It is said that today’s reader is tomorrow’s leader. Do you agree with this statement? Explain.<br>
Yes, I agree with the statement that today’s reader is tomorrow’s leader. Undoubtedly, reading is essential for all-round development of the personality. Reading is an essential basic skills building activity. One’s language fluency is determined by the quality of reading. Besides, vocabulary enrichment, ideas collection, familiarization with different types of writing formats, speaking fluency, etc, all depend upon reading.
<br><br>
It is true a person who has the reading habit, never feels lonely and bored. The books open up a magical world for him or her and he lives among angels in the pages of the books. Books never let go the readers astray. They make them wise and pragmatic. We must endeavour to develop this fabulous habit of reading.
<br><br>
Thus, one thing is absolutely clear, if we want to become great leaders in future, we must be great readers in the present.
<br><br>
c. Write a short biography of a national literary, artistic or historical figure you appreciate most.<br>
Bhanubhakta Acharya<br>
<br>
The first Nepali poet who also translated the great epic ‘Ramayana’ from Sanskrit to Nepali, Bhanubhakta Acharya was born on 29 Ashar, 1814 in Tanahu district of Nepal. Acharya was born to a Brahmin family and received excellent education with a strong leaning towards religion from his grandfather at home. He is honored with the title Adikabi for the contributions he has made in the field of poetry and Nepali literature and every year, his birthday is celebrated as a festival of Bhanujayanti (13 July) by conducting various programs, usually academics and poem recitation.
<br><br>
He wrote two masterpieces in his life among which, one is the Bhanubhaktey Ramayan and the other is a letter he wrote in verse form to the Prime Minister while he was in prison. He was made a scapegoat and sent to prison due to some misunderstanding in signing the papers. His letter became one of his great works. He not only won his freedom with his poem but was also given a bag of money. When he died in 1868, he did not know he would one day be one of the most revered poets of Nepal. His creation, however, was not published and he died without receiving credit for his contribution. His works were published by Motiram Bhatta in 1887. Although he is one of the most celebrated and revered poets of Nepal, his works are not as famous as other poets in the history of Nepali literature.
