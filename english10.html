<br>
Critical thinking<br>
<br>
a. What can be the expectations of the parents from their offspring at the old age?<br>
Every human is different. Often times what one desires the other does not even see fit. Our parents are also one among the same crowd, like us. There must be some expectations they have from their children, our work is to understand and fulfill them.
<br><br>
When people get old, they get sensitive and even the slightest of things hurt them. Same goes for the elderly parent. They have lived a full life, worked, earned respect, and fulfilled their responsibilities. So when they are old, they want us not to forget this and treat them with dignity and respect.
<br><br>
After retirement the elderly people do not find purpose and meaning in their day, most of the time they do not have routine. So most of them stay usually alone at home. Often times we hear them complain that no one spends time with them, they miss company, they have nothing to do, no one to talk to, etc.
<br><br>
Your father was the one taking care of everything before he retired, your mother was so busy all her life looking after her family and now because they are old they have near to nothing to do during their day. They want their children to involve them in conversations, decisions or any other big and small thing.
<br><br>
These were just some common things that the elderly parents miss and want from you or want their children to know. But again every person and their wants are different, so we do the things according to our parent’s desire.
<br><br><br>
b. Some children who live in a distance tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. Why do you think they are like that? Discuss.<br>
There are various reasons for children to live in a distance from their parents. The reason may be study, job, business and so on. For achieving their goal and fulfilling their self desires, they have to invest more time and efforts and hence their realtion with parents becomes weaker due to of their busy schedule. When children live in a distance, they gradually keep away relation from their parents. Finally, it creates a gap or distance between parents and their children. In todays world childrens think that money and success are more important than the parents’ feelings. They do hard work for earning and saving but not making the parents happy.
<br><br>
Some children begin a new life with their family far from their parents. Their wife and children become more important than their old-age parents. That is why they have no time to call them and visit their parents. This indifference not only degrades the relationship between the parents and their children but also makes the parents live a lonely and miserable life.
<br><br><br>
c. A mother’s love is everlasting and indispensable. Justify.<br>
There is nothing that can come close to the love that a mother feels for her children. Women are inherently good mothers. Till birth women carry their young and then continue their love & affection throughout their childhood and even into adulthood. Every Mother always makes sure that their children are safe and happy throughout their childhood. It is the love for their child that a mother feels that drives these feelings.
<br><br>
After birth, a child finds his mom as the first friend who plays with him along with extra care and nourishment. Without any expectation, a mother keeps on working for the betterment of her child. She plays all roles including mom like a mentor, a teacher, a friend, a caretaker. When a child born; it is the mother who easily understands the feelings or requirements of her child. She spends every second around her child for fulfilling his all needs. Since childhood, our mother keeps telling us what is wrong and what is right in a manner to build us as a good human being and also encourage us to do good things in life.
<br><br>
We as a child always take our mother for granted but without her our life becomes worthless. Mother is a precious gift by God which we need to keep with love and care. She does her job of motherhood with a pure heart and complete devotion. The first teacher is a mother for any child and if he keeps learning life’s lessons under her guidance nothing can stop him in achieving the heights of success.
