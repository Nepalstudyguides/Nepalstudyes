Critical thinking<br>
<br>
a. Do you think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life’s most memorable moments? Give reasons in support of your answer.<br>
Technology is the machines and tools we use to convert natural or mental resources into things we need, like energy or algorithms. Technology can be used in so many different ways, positive and negative, that the answers have become as convoluted and complicated as human interaction. It follows, therefore, that some technology is right for children in a learning and social environment, and some technology is not.
<br><br>
Most of the schools and colleges are using modern devices like laptops and tablets as a means of teaching. So the students are also using the same devices to be on par with the teachings of the teachers. In the present day, social media has evolved leaps and bounds, with 90% of the world’s population using social media. So the devices which are provided to the students for studying are instead used to be active on social media. Students are not studying with the help of these devices, they are interested in checking the posts and status updates of their near and dear ones and many other things. This is how technology is becoming a huge distraction for the learners, thus increasing the gap between students and educators.
<br><br>
In the present day, due to the huge advancement of technology, teachers are educating the students with different online tools instead of physically communicating with them, hence the students are unable to interact with the students and also cannot share problems with them. Teachers miserably fail to draw the attention of the student. It is recommended to use verbal communication with the students along with using online tools. So the students can learn the topics as well as they can share their problems with the teacher.
<br><br>
Thus its true that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life’s most memorable moments.

b. Kline’s essay focuses on the contrast between her son’s freshman college experience and her own, but she also establishes what they have in common. Explain.<br>
The essay entitled “Taking my son to College, Where Technology has Replaced Serendipity” written by Christina Baker Kline is about the contrast between her college experience and her son’s experience. But the essay also includes the common things between her and her son. She talks about the experience of freshman college year in the same university. Although technology has replaced the way they do everything but still the education system was all same. All the old feelings and emotions were also the same. There were much more difficulty on her time comparing to her son’s age but still, friendships and team working has not changed. These things are all same in some way. Exploration about the new things ware limited to physical doings, but now at the time of his son, the exploration and research is still the same, but it is done via technology medium, via search engines, E-books rather than physical books. Relationship and friendship was the struggle for freshman at her time, still search for the companion was prominent. This thing still prevails in electronic form from facebook, instagram and social media.
<br><br>
c. Has the internet aided to broadening or narrowing the critical thinking capacity of youths or readers? How?<br>
Internet is a global network of interconnected networks of computers. It makes it easier and quick for people to access information sitting at any corner of the world. Just like any other technology, internet too has its own share of positive and negative effects on society. If internet is used to gain and explore knowledge, it is broadening of knowledge, but if you started relying on interent answers with blunt creativity, it is narrowing of the critical thinking capacity. The world of internet is so infinite that it can seem overwhelming. All forms of media don’t work in every setting. There needs to be a balance of modern technology in life, or you run the risk of losing out on developing fundamental skills. Internet is an excellent boost to your critical thinking skills, but you should be aware of some of the pitfalls that come along with it. Thus depending on how you’re using it, internet can be enhancing or damaging to critical thinking.
